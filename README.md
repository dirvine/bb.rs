# `bb.rs`

Rust library to do GPIO on the beaglebone

This library has been fully developed *on* the beaglebone using cargo!

(There are no official rust/cargo nightlies for ARM, but I'm unofficially
hosting my own [here][ruststrap])

# [Documentation][docs]

# Features

Very early WIP

* Only the GPIO wired to the board LEDs can be used
* Device tree stuff will come later

# License
